# Introduction

In an interview it is really important. Sorting is not a big deal when it comes to small data, but when it comes to large data, we must focus on optimization where we need to learn about the types of sorting algorithms

Algorithms Covered:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

# Issue with `sort()`

There are many ways we can sort things and with small differences there is a lot to be taken into consideration.

# Sorting Algorithms

- Radix Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort
